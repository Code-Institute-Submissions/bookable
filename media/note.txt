After many tests, I put the original media folder inside the static
folder. Because of how Cloudinary work, it is not as straightforward as
I thought. Having the media folder outside static even tho.
I have added the correct settings in the settings file;

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

and

 + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

Folder and files are still not uploaded to Cloudinary.
