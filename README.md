    #### Typography

-   #### Imagery

    -   The purpose of the images is to make the app more appealing.
    -   The colors and images all serve to be aligned with and assist in the app's branding.
    -   The images also intend to give the app an identity the user can relate to, lifting its overall impression.

### Skeleton

<!-- (How the infomation implemented), (how will the user navigate), (how the content relate to each other, low, mid top priority, how and where to position content)? -->

<br>

### Structure

<!-- How is the information, logically grouped, the feature the elements the data? -->

For the initial design of this Django project, I chose a monolith design because of the size of this project.

As seen below, the initial data model built for this project laid the foundation for how the app should work.

![data-model](./docs/planes/structure/data-model-v4.png)

<br>

A database diagram was created using Datagrip:

![database-diagram](./docs/planes/structure/database-diagram.jpg)

<br>

### Scope

This project has been made without any email capabilities, I did not see the need for it. This project is just an illustration of a general booking app.

#### Minimum viable product

The minimum this app should include:

1. The ability to register as a company without market boundaries.
2. The ability to add relevant company information.
3. The ability to have a company booking page.
4. The ability to accept bookings without customer accounts.
5. The ability to see all bookings.
6. The ability for booking makers to delete/cancel their booking.

<br>

#### Desired features

The desired features this would want:

1. The ability to receive booking confirmation emails.
2. The ability for companies to manage their bookings.
3. The ability to add products/services etc.
4. The ability to separate between private & company booking makers.

<br>

### Strategy

<br>

#### App Goal:

- The app is targeted towards any service providers from dentists to spa and restaurants, to make their bookings easiler to accept and manage.

<br>

#### Agile Development:

- Agile development methodology was using for this project, planning, developing and delivering in small sprints. There were 3 sprints in total spaced out over 1 month with:
  - the admin epic, 1/3 of the total time.
  - the company epic, 1/2 of the total time.
  - the customer epic, 1/3 of the total time

<br>

All epics were assigned labels:
- must have
- should have
- could have

All epics were priortized according to their labeling as must have was done first and then should have while could have were not developed due to the deadline of this project. Nice to have were not used for this project as that list could easily grow beyond the scope of this project.

The kanban board used was created using Githubs projects and can be seen [here](https://github.com/MTraveller/bookable/projects/1 "Kanban board")

![Kanban-Board](./docs/planes/strategy/kanban-board.jpg "Kanban board")

#### Epics

The project have 3 main epics each supplementing the previous, also in each epic testing was done and related bugs, errors etc. was fixed and related front-end user reporting was created, i.e. 404 error page.

<br>

Epic 1 - Admin with data model setup

The epic 1 was the foundation of the app going forward. The data model for all epics were developed, then the admin portion of the app.

<br>

Epic 2 - Company User

The epic 2 was the main epic taking up most of the time as the whole app was based around this epic.

<br>

Epic 3 - Site User

The epic 3 was the last and final epic bringing the company model and the booking model together.

#### User Stories

### Dev HTML



<br>

### Dev CSS



<br>

### Dev Django

From the very beginning of the project, it was essential to differentiate between the development and production environments.

That is why I chose to opt for a common settings file for the project and separate dev/prod files inheriting everything from common but each with their variables depending on where the app is running.

I moved and renamed the settings.py file and made the necessary changes to the dependencies.

<br>



<br>

## Testings

From the beginning, I did manual testing and debugging throughout the project's development. A tool that came in handy was the django-debug-toolbar extension that I have come to love.

### Python Code

[Testings.md]()

### Lighthouse



<br>

### Accessibility

The app was tested with [color.a11y.com/Contrast](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/ "color.a11y.com/Contrast") for any accessability issues.

![Result]()

<br>

The social card image was tested with [brandwood.com/a11y/](https://www.brandwood.com/a11y/ "brandwood.com/a11y/") for any accessability issues.

![Result]()

<br>

### Bugs

I have grown fond of eliminating bugs found in my code as I intentionally try to provoke and find them.

<br>

This one is more of a warning but a bug for what that specific query.

![Unorderedlistwarning](/docs/bugs/unorderedlistwarning.jpg)
   - For this warning I added order_by to the booking model.

<br>

The booking URL object id URL bug when object was deleted.

![URL Bug](/docs/bugs/company-does-not-exist-booking-does-not-exist-bug.jpg)
   - Notice /thank-you/88/ at the end, this should render next image, but instead renders company.

<br>

![URL Bug Fix](/docs/bugs/company-does-not-exist-booking-does-not-exist-bug-fix.jpg)
   - By adding a condition to check whether /booking/<slug:slug>/ is the same as request.path
   this bug was solved.
